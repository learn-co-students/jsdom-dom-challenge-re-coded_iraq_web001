`js/challenge.js` - it's already included in the HTML via a `<script>` tag, so when you add your code, it will run on the page.

Add the following features one by one, refreshing the page to see your functionality working as you build.

> Note: These deliverables are written in the form of _User Stories_. They describe the features from the perspective of a user when they visit the page.

1. As a user, I should see the timer increment every second once the page has loaded.
2. As a user, I can manually increment and decrement the counter using the plus and minus buttons.
3. As a user, I can 'like' an individual number of the counter. I should see count of the number of 'likes' associated with that number.
4. As a user, I can pause the counter, which should 

  * pause the counter
  * disable all buttons except the pause button
  * the pause button should then show the text "resume."

  When 'resume' is clicked, it should restart the counter and re-enable the buttons.
5. As a user, I can leave comments on my gameplay, such as: "Wow, what a fun game this is."
